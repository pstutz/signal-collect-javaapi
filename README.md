How to Import and Compile the Project
-------------------------------------
The signal-collect (core) project is required for the signal-collect-javaapi project to work. Follow the instructions from the main page/README file of the signal-collect project.

Make sure to clone the signal-collect-javaapi project inside the same folder as the signal-collect-project. 

Check that both projects are on their Master branches and are at their latest versions. 

Go to the project folder and start SBT on the command line. The output should end with:
"[info] Set current project to signal-collect-javaapi (in build file:XYZ/signal-collect-javaapi/)"

To generate a .jar file with dependencies, use the "assembly" command on the SBT prompt.

To generate an Eclipse project, use the "eclipse" command on the SBT prompt.



How to Develop in Eclipse
-------------------------
Follow the instructions in the signal-collect project on how to install and configure Eclipse IDE 3.7 (Indigo) for Java developers and how to import the signal-collect (core) project.

Generate an Eclipse project for signal-collect-javaapi as described above.

Open the Scala project that was generated by SBT with: File -> Import... -> General -> Existing Projects into Workspace -> select signal-collect-javaapi folder
